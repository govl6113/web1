    <br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. <br>JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.<br> The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
    <br>
    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
    <br>It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    <br>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. 
    <br>In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other runtime systems, such as Node.js and Deno. 
    <br>These systems are used to build servers and are also integrated into frameworks, such as Electron and Cordova, for creating a variety of applications.
    <br>Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
